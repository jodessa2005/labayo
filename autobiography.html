            <p><b>Ma.Jodessa Barawid-Labayo</b>, born on January 8, 2005, in <b>Panlayaan, Sorsogon City</b>, has faced several challenges in life at the age of 19. As the youngest child and only daughter in a family with two brothers, Jodessa learned valuable lessons in strength and gratitude from her mother, who constantly encouraged her to stand firm despite difficulties. Throughout her childhood, Jodessa experienced both joyful moments and tough times. Though some people initially found her strong personality intimidating, those who took the time to know her discovered her friendly and cheerful nature. Jodessa loved to joke around and share laughter with her friends, creating a warm atmosphere wherever she went.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>In her early years, She cherished the time spent with her cousin, finding happiness in their togetherness. However, as she grew older, she faced emotional battles. When she felt sad or encountered minor problems, she often refrained from seeking advice from her family, especially her parents. She would tell them she was okay, despite her true feelings. Jodessa believed that being honest about her struggles might make her parents worry, and she held huge respect for them. Although she didn't express her love directly to her parents, the depth of her affection and admiration was undeniable.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Her parents, who only graduated from high school, dreamed of supporting their children in achieving higher education. Unfortunately, due to various struggles, her second brother completed only high school, while her elder brother pursued engineering in college. However, when an opportunity arose for her brother to study <b>BS Criminology</b> in <b>Manila</b>, the <b>COVID-19 pandemic</b> struck, leading to job losses for both her parents and creating significant financial strain. During this challenging time, her older brother made a sacrifice. Instead of continuing his studies, he returned home to work and support their Family. His dedication and hard work to provide for Jodessa and their parents became a source of inspiration for her.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Witnessing his efforts, Jodessa maintained a positive attitude, focusing on her academic success as a way to contribute to her family's well-being. Inspired by her brother's sacrifices, she aimed for high grades, recognizing that her achievements would honor their struggles. Jodessa set her sights on becoming a policewoman. She envisioned this career as a means to give back to her brother. Her determination and dedication led to her becoming an academic scholar in her first year of college. This recognition brought her joy, as it validated her hard work and lightened her family's financial burden, allowing her to concentrate on her education.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>As Jodessa continues her journey, she remains committed to her studies and aspirations to become a policewoman. Despite facing mental and emotional exhaustion at times, she perseveres, seeking guidance to endure the burdens she carries. Her determination continues to drive her forward. One of her favorite quotes was, It's not how much we give but how much love we put into giving. It says that the value of a gift is not measured by its price but by the care and affection behind it. She understood that true generosity comes from the heart, and it is the love that makes any gift meaningful. Her mother had taught her an important lesson about giving. She explained that sometimes it is better to give than to receive because what you give can come back to you in ways you might not expect, often boosting the joy you experience.</p>
